# Concept
Android launcher with Machine learning. It should predict you're actions instead of having a static screen without any context.

# Based on
- App usage
- Calls
- Location
- Time of year
- Day of week
- Time
- Agenda?
- ...?


# Simmelar software

_Seperate launcher_  
✔ Suggestions are decent (though they seem to be based on app usage only)  
❌ Useless bubble inteface  
❌ Not UX friendly
